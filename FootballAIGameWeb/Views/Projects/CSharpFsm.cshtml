    <h3>Basic information</h3>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        You need at least C# 3.0 compiler to compile the project. The default project target framework is
        .NET 3.5 but you can change it to higher versions to use new .NET features.

    <h3>AI Architecture Overview</h3>
    <p>
        For basic overview of the Ai class visit
        <a href="/Projects/CSharp">Basic C# project page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The AI specific classes are mainly located in the UserClasses folder.

        <h5>Entities</h5>
        The entities are the extensions of the basic simulation entities classes.
        There is the team class which represents the team and abstract player class with
        its subclasses that represent certain player roles. Every player and team has GetAction(s) method
        that retrieve the player desired actions. Team's LoadState method is called every simulation step
        before GetActions is called so that the team properties (players...) are correctly updated. Also
        entities provide many useful utility functions and properties.

        <h5>States</h5>
        Every entity is always in one normal state that can be changed to other state during the execution.
        Also every entity has its global state that never changes. States have methods for entering the
        state, exiting the state and methods that will execute each simulation step while the player is
        in the given state. State might have it's own local data.

        <h5>FiniteStateMachine</h5>
        Every entity owns an instance of this class. It keeps the entity current and global state and provides methods
        for correct state transitions and updates. Update method is called each simulation step.

        <h5>SteeringBehaviors</h5>
        These classes define variety of movements that football player might do. They have methods for computing
        the desired movement vector of the behavior.

        <h5>SteeringBehaviorManager</h5>
        Every player owns an instance of this class. It provides methods for adding and removing steering behavior
        of the player. Its CalculateAccelerationVector is used every simulation step to get the player's movement action.

        <h5>Messages</h5>
        Messages are used for sending requests between entities. For example player might request pass from another player.
        Messages are sent through MessageDispatcher. States have OnMessage method that handles these messages. Firstly
        the current state OnMessage method is called and if it doesn't handle the message, then it is handled by the global
        state OnMessage method (this is the main reason for global state hierarchy - goalkeepers might handle messages differently
        than forwards etc.).

        <h5>Region</h5>
        This class is located in CustomDataTypes.  It is used for defining home regions of the players. Every player
        has its home region (used by MoveToHomeRegion player state). Usually team states set the home region accordingly.
        
        <h5>SupportPositionManager</h5>
        Located in Utilities (in UserClasses). Singleton class that is used for evaluating positions by certain criteria (safe pass/shot possible ...).
        It is used by SupportControlling player state. Its update method is called every simulation step (from Ai class).
        
        <h5>Ai</h5>
        On top of the basic Ai class responsibilities (from basic project) the main AI class is also responsible for holding team entities and calling appropriate entities methods to
        get the correct AI action in every simulation step. It is implemented as singleton so that we can access from any method
        the information about the current state and also all the created entities.
        
        <h5>Parameters</h5>
        Holds all the AI constants that control the AI behavior.
